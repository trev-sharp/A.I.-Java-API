# A.I.-Java-API
Open Source A.I Api - Semi-Customizable Nodes

This A.I. Is A Neural Network Comprised Of The Choice Of 1 Or 3 Hidden Layers. Uses The Feed-Foward Method To Guess And Uses Back Propagation To Train. Demestrates How To Use Matrix's And Math Functions To Build A Working Neural Network.

NOTE - This API I Made Is Fairly Messy And Wasn't Attented To Be A Public Resource. This API Can Throw Errors If Not Used Properly. This API Is Only Intended For Developers To Better Understand How Neural Networks Work And How To Implement Them In Their Projects.
